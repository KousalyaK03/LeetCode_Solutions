# Approach:
# - Use a stack to keep track of open brackets.
# - Iterate through the string and push open brackets onto the stack.
# - For closing brackets, check if the stack is not empty and if the top of the stack matches the closing bracket.
# - If it matches, pop the stack; otherwise, return False.
# - At the end, the stack must be empty for the string to be valid.

# Time Complexity: O(N), where N is the length of the string.
# Space Complexity: O(N), for the stack in the worst case if all characters are open brackets.
# Did this code successfully run on Leetcode: Yes
# Any problem you faced while coding this: None
