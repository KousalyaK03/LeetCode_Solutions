        Approach:
        - Use Kruskal's Algorithm with Union-Find to build a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST).
        - Consider each house as a node and each pipe as an edge.
        - Introduce a virtual node (0) that connects to every house with the cost of digging a well.
        - Sort all edges (pipes + wells) by cost and use Union-Find to connect components.

        Time Complexity: O((n + m) log (n + m)), where n is the number of houses, and m is the number of pipes.
        Space Complexity: O(n + m), for storing the graph and DSU.
